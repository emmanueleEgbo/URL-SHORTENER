URL Shortener
A production-style URL shortener built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL (via asyncpg + SQLAlchemy async ORM), and Redis as a write-through cache. Migrations are managed with Alembic. Outbound webhooks deliver real-time event notifications when URLs are created, clicked, or deleted.

Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost/url_shortener
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=0
REDIS_PASSWORD=          # leave blank if no password
DATABASE_URL must use the postgresql+asyncpg:// scheme — the app uses an async engine.

Setup
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Create the database (psql example)
createdb url_shortener

# 4. Run migrations (see Alembic section below)
alembic upgrade head

# 5. Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
API Endpoints
URL Endpoints
All URL routes are prefixed with /v1.

Method	Path	Description
POST	/v1/links	Create a new short URL
GET	/v1/links	List all stored short URLs
GET	/v1/links/{short_code}	Redirect (307) to the original long URL
DELETE	/v1/links/{short_code}	Delete a short URL (also evicts cache)
POST /v1/links
Request body:

{
  "long_url": "https://example.com/some/very/long/path",
  "title": "My Link"
}
title is optional.

Response 201:

{
  "short_code": "X9D7FF",
  "long_url": "https://example.com/some/very/long/path",
  "title": "My Link"
}
DELETE /v1/links/{short_code}
Returns 204 No Content on success, 404 if the short code does not exist.

Webhook Endpoints
All webhook routes are prefixed with /v1/webhooks.

Method	Path	Description
POST	/v1/webhooks	Register a new webhook endpoint
GET	/v1/webhooks	List all registered webhooks
DELETE	/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}	Remove a webhook registration
POST	/v1/webhooks/{webhook_id}/test	Send a synthetic test payload to the endpoint
POST /v1/webhooks
Request body:

{
  "name": "My Listener",
  "url": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id",
  "events": ["url.created", "url.clicked", "url.deleted"]
}
Response 201:

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "My Listener",
  "url": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id",
  "events": ["url.created", "url.clicked", "url.deleted"],
  "is_active": true,
  "created_at": "2026-04-25T10:00:00+00:00"
}
Supported events:

Event	When it fires
url.created	A new short URL is successfully created
url.clicked	A redirect request resolves a short code
url.deleted	A short URL is deleted
Webhook payload format
Every event delivers a JSON body in this shape:

{
  "event": "url.created",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-25T10:00:00+00:00",
  "data": { ... }
}
Tip: Use https://webhook.site to get a free listener URL for testing — paste it as the url when registering a webhook, then use the /test endpoint to verify connectivity before waiting for real events.

How Caching Works
Incoming redirect request
        │
        ▼
  Redis lookup (url_shortcode:<code>)
        │
   Hit ─┼─ Miss
        │         │
        ▼         ▼
   Redirect    DB lookup
                  │
              Found ─┬─ Not Found → 404
                     │
              Write to Redis (TTL 1 hr)
                     │
                     ▼
                 Redirect
Cache keys are namespaced: url_shortcode:{short_code}
TTL defaults to 1 hour on write-through; 5 minutes on direct set_cache calls
Deleting a URL also evicts its cache entry
How Webhooks Work
URL event (create / click / delete)
        │
        ▼
  fire_event() called from route handler
        │
        ▼
  Load active webhooks subscribed to this event
        │
        ▼
  asyncio.create_task(_deliver(...))  ← non-blocking, fire-and-forget
        │
        ▼
  API response returns immediately
        │           │
        │           ▼ (background)
        │     POST JSON payload to each target URL
        │     Errors are logged, never propagated
Delivery is fire-and-forget — the API response is never delayed by webhook calls
Delivery errors are logged but do not affect the API caller
Each POST includes Content-Type: application/json and X-Webhook-Event headers
Alembic — Database Migrations
Alembic is configured for async SQLAlchemy (asyncpg). Always run these from the project root.

# Generate a migration by comparing your models to the actual database
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "create urls table"

# Apply all pending migrations — brings the DB up to date
alembic upgrade head

# Roll back the last migration — undo the most recent change
alembic downgrade -1

# Check what migration the database is currently at
alembic current

# View the full migration history
alembic history --verbose

# Show pending migrations (what upgrade head would apply)
alembic history -r current:head
First-time migration workflow
# 1. Autogenerate the initial migration from your models
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial schema"

# 2. Review the generated file in alembic/versions/ before applying
# 3. Apply it
alembic upgrade head
Always review autogenerated migrations before running them — Alembic may miss some changes (e.g. renamed columns, custom constraints).

Running in Production
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4
Interactive docs are available at http://localhost:8000/docs when the server is running.

Set echo=True on the engine in database.py only for debugging — it logs every SQL query.
